## 🎯 Overview

KinAI-GeoPulse is a privacy-focused location tracking and geofencing microservice designed to provide real-time family location data, distance-from-home calculations, and geofence-based alerts. Built with FastAPI and integrated with Traccar, it ensures secure, local processing of location data while seamlessly contributing to the KinAI Ecosystem's natural language chat capabilities.

This project enables families to stay connected with actionable insights, such as knowing when a family member arrives home or leaves a designated area, all while prioritizing data sovereignty and privacy.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- 📍 **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Monitors family members' locations via Traccar-connected devices.
- 🏠 **Distance-from-Home Calculation**: Computes distances between current locations and a predefined home coordinate using the Haversine formula.
- 🔔 **Geofencing Alerts**: Tracks entries and exits from predefined zones for safety and awareness.
- 🔋 **Device Status Monitoring**: Provides device details like battery levels and last update times.
- 🔒 **Privacy-First Design**: Local processing with secure API authentication and no cloud dependency.
- 🔗 **KinAI Ecosystem Integration**: Feeds location and geofencing data into the natural language chat hub for contextual responses.

---

## 💬 Contribution to KinAI Ecosystem

KinAI-GeoPulse plays a critical role in the KinAI Ecosystem by providing **location-based contextual data** to the natural language chat hub. This data enhances the AI's ability to deliver meaningful, family-centric responses, integrating seamlessly with other KinAI projects like KinAI-Vision, KinAI-CareVault, KinAI-NexPatrol, KinAI-ScholarKit, and KinAI-Mentor.

### 📊 Data Provided to the KinAI Ecosystem

| Data Type | Description | Example Use in Chat |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Current Location** | Latitude, longitude, and address of family members' devices | **Q:** "Where is Emma?" **A:** "Emma is at school, located at 123 Main St, 5 km from home." |
| **Distance from Home** | Distance (in km) from a predefined home coordinate | **Q:** "Is anyone near home?" **A:** "Logu is 0.5 km from home, likely arriving soon." |
| **Geofence Events** | Entry/exit events for predefined zones (e.g., home, school) | **Q:** "Did Sarah leave school?" **A:** "Sarah left the school geofence at 3:15 PM." |
| **Device Status** | Battery level, last update time, and device activity status | **Q:** "Is dad's phone okay?" **A:** "Dad's phone is active with 80% battery, last updated 5 minutes ago." |
| **Daily Summary** | Summary of a device's movements and activities for the day | **Q:** "What did Logu do today?" **A:** "Logu traveled 12 km, visited the office, and spent 4 hours at home." |
| **Recent Events** | Recent location-related events (e.g., speeding, zone entry) | **Q:** "Any updates on Emma?" **A:** "Emma entered the park geofence at 4:30 PM." |

### 🔄 Integration Benefits

- **Contextual Awareness**: Combines location data with KinAI-Vision (home activity) and KinAI-CareVault (health status) for responses like, "Emma is at school and her vitals are normal."
- **Family Safety**: Enhances KinAI-NexPatrol's security alerts with location context, e.g., "An unrecognized visitor is at the door, and Sarah is 10 km away."
- **Activity Correlation**: Links location with KinAI-ScholarKit's educational progress, e.g., "Emma completed her homework at the library."
- **Real-Time Insights**: Powers the natural language chat hub to provide timely, actionable answers, strengthening family connectivity.
